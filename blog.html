    <h1>Scope of var, let, and const:</h1>
    <p>
        <h3>1. Var</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables declared with var are function-scoped or globally scoped. This means that their scope is limited to the function in which they are declared, or if declared outside of any function, they are global variables.</li>
            <li>
                They can be re-declared and updated within their scope.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>2. let:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables declared with let have block scope. This means they are only accessible within the block ({}) in which they are defined.</li>
            <li>
                They can be reassigned within their scope, but not re-declared in the same scope.

            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <h3>3. const:
        </h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Variables declared with const also have block scope.</li>
            <li>
                They cannot be reassigned once they are declared, though their contents (if they are objects or arrays) can be modified.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <h2>Use cases of null and undefined:
    </h2>

    <ul>
        <li>null: It represents the intentional absence of any object value. It's often used to explicitly set a variable to an "empty" or "non-existent" state. For example, you might set a variable to null to indicate that it hasn't been assigned a value yet.</li>
        <li>undefined: It typically means a variable has been declared but has not yet been assigned a value. It's the default value of uninitialized variables in JavaScript. It can also arise when accessing properties of objects that don't exist or when a function doesn't return anything explicitly.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>REST API:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>REST (Representational State Transfer) API is a software architectural style for creating scalable web services. It is based on the principles of REST, which include stateless communication, client-server architecture, uniform interface, cacheability, layered system, and code-on-demand (optional).</li>
    </ul>
